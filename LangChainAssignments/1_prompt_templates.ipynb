      "### Recommended Ingredients for a Serum:  \n",
      "#### 1. **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**  \n",
      "   - **Why it helps:**  \n",
      "     Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that brightens dull skin by reducing pigmentation and promoting collagen production. It also protects against environmental damage, which can contribute to a lackluster complexion.  \n",
      "   - **Best Form:** Look for stabilized forms like Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate or Ascorbyl Glucoside for combination skin to avoid irritation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)**  \n",
      "   - **Why it helps:**  \n",
      "     Niacinamide improves skin texture and tone by boosting cell turnover and reducing dullness. It also balances oil production, making it ideal for combination skin. Additionally, it strengthens the skin barrier, enhancing hydration and radiance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Hyaluronic Acid**  \n",
      "   - **Why it helps:**  \n",
      "     Hyaluronic Acid hydrates the skin deeply, plumping it and reducing the appearance of dullness. It works well for combination skin as it provides lightweight hydration without clogging pores or making oily areas greasy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Ingredient to Avoid:  \n",
      "#### **Alcohol (Denatured Alcohol or SD Alcohol)**  \n",
      "   - **Why to avoid:**  \n",
      "     Alcohol can excessively dry out the skin, leading to irritation and imbalance, especially for combination skin. It may worsen dullness by stripping the skin of its natural moisture and disrupting the barrier function.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:  \n",
      "For a serum targeting dullness on combination skin, prioritize **Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid** for brightening, balancing, and hydration. Avoid **Alcohol** to prevent dryness and irritation.\n"
