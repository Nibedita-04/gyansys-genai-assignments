      "#### 3. **Practical Tips for Formulating with Niacinamide**\n",
      "- **Stability**: Niacinamide is stable in water-based formulations and works well in emulsions. Avoid combining it with highly acidic ingredients (e.g., pure Vitamin C at low pH) to prevent the formation of niacin, which can cause skin irritation.\n",
      "- **Solubility**: Niacinamide is water-soluble, so it should be dissolved in the water phase of formulations.\n",
      "- **pH Compatibility**: Maintain a pH range of 5-7 for optimal stability and efficacy.\n",
      "- **Skin Sensitivity**: At higher concentrations (above 5%), some individuals may experience mild irritation. Always recommend patch testing for sensitive skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can create effective and stable formulations that leverage the full potential of niacinamide for both skincare and haircare applications.\n",
